# One Minute Paper

One Minute Paper is an Android application based on the concept retrieval learning. Retrieval learning is a strategy used to improve learning and memory recall. This app focuses on a simple method for implementing retrieval learning into your daily life. After taking a class, reading a chapter, listening to a lecture, or learning in any other way you fill out the two questions in the app without looking at notes. This will allow you to recall the main points and think about any areas that were unclear. More information can be found at [RetrievalPractice.org](https://www.retrievalpractice.org/)

## Motivation

This project was created after hearing about the concept in an audiobook. This app became an opportunity for me to apply many of the different Android development skills I had learned over the past year to my own work.

## Features

* SQLite database for storage
* Tabbed Layout
* Ability to track or delete past papers
* Simple and minimal user interface
